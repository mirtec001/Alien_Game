# Alien_Game
Simple game written in Rust with macroquad

Been playing with this idea for a little while.

Used quite a bit from https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/blob/master/examples/asteroids.rs. 

Loving macroquad and will keep expanding this game.  Huge thanks to https://github.com/not-fl3 for creating an amazing tool.
